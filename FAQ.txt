Build folder directory is client/src/contracts folder. Delete this
and then run 'truffle migrate --reset --compile-all' if you have issues 
with running the tests or any of the solidity files.

Prerequisites:

1. Ensure you have an instance of Ganache-cli running.
2. Also, make sure you have Truffle installed in order to run the following commands.

How to run:

1. Run 'truffle compile' and then 'truffle migrate'
2. Run 'truffle test' each time you edit a test and want to run it. 
No need to recompile or run the migrations again.
